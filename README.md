## Project Overview
A cutting-edge payment gateway application called TrustTransact was created to improve the user experience for customers and businesses by streamlining payment procedures. Our main goal is to make payment transactions as simple as possible while upholding the highest standards of security and dependability. It is also prepared to be Dockerized.

## Key Features

* Customizable Integration: TrustTransact provides well-documented APIs for simple integration with e-commerce platforms since it is designed for easy connection.

* Real-time Payment Status: Real-time information on payment statuses are provided, enabling merchants to keep track of transactions and giving customers rapid confirmation.

* Callback Notifications: TrustTransact enables automated callback notifications, decreasing the need for manual status checks by informing merchants of successful or unsuccessful payments.

## Technology Stack
* Django: The dependable and adaptable Django framework, renowned for creating web applications, powers this backend.


* RESTful API: Now, easy connection between TrustTransact and other systems is made possible by a skillfully structured RESTful API architecture. This system guarantees efficient, uniform data interchange, supporting interoperability.


* Database Management: By using a strong relational database system, data integrity and scalability are both rigorously maintained.


* Celery: Utilizing the Celery library enables effective management of asynchronous processes, including notifications and status verifications.
